## How to take care with this app?

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.<br />
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.<br />
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).<br />
